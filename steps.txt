1- Design the store: 
[
    {
        id:1,
        description: "",
        resolved: false
    },
    {...},
    {...}, 
    {...}, 
]


2- Defining the Actions:

* Add a Bug
* Mark as Resolved
* Delete a Bug

exp of action: 
{
    type: "ADD_BUG",
    description: "..."
}

remarque: 
you should use a descriptive string for the type .. by convention all uppercased separated by '_' but you can use any naming convention, e.g. "bugAdded"

- the description is the data associated with this Action

Redux was inspired by flux which is an architectural pattern and a library built by Facebook, in flux actions have slightly different structure:

{
    type: "bugAdded",
    payload: {
        description: "...",
    }
}

you don't have to follow this structure in Redux because Redux doesn't care, but it give my actions a common and consistent structure

3- Creating a Reducer
